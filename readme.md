# MavenTech BI Dashboard Project

## About this project

### Project Description
In this project, I played the role of a BI developer at MavenTech, a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. MavenTech has been using a new CRM system to track sales opportunities but has had no visibility of the data outside the platform. 

In an effort to become a data-driven organization, the company aimed to create an interactive dashboard to enable sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance.

### The Dataset
The data consists of B2B sales opportunities sourced from a CRM database, including information on accounts, products, sales teams, and sales opportunities.

### Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to provide sales managers with a comprehensive view of their team's performance. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to measure team effectiveness:

- **Total Sales**: Total dollars made from sales.
- **No. Sales**: Total number of sa
- **Avg. Sale Value**: Average price at which a product is sold.
- **Avg. Weeks to Close**: The average time in weeks to close a deal.
- **Conversion Percentage**: The percentage of won sales.
- **Percentage of Sales Discounted**: The percentage of products sold at a price lower than their suggested retail price.

These KPIs are calculated for each team for the latest quarter, which is the fourth quarter of 2017 in the dataset.

Additionally, sales managers wanted the ability to compare their team's performance to other teams and view the overall performance for the current year.

## The Dashboard

### Current Quarter Performance
This is the main page of the dashboard. It displays a summary of the KPIs for the current quarter. Sales managers can select their name from a filter, and all the report pages will show data relevant to their team.

Key features:
- **Sales Breakdown**: From the total sales card, users can click the arrow to dive deeper into the sales breakdown for the current quarter. This allows managers to identify success areas and see detailed information on each sold item.
- **Opportunities to Close**: From the "Potential to Close" card, managers can examine all opportunities marked as engaging for their team. This enables prioritization of actions like following up on offers before the end of the quarter and performing CRM cleanups for opportunities that have been open for too long.

### Performance by Team
This page allows sales managers to view how their team is performing in comparison to other teams by ranking all teams across key metrics. It provides a clear benchmark to evaluate team effectiveness.
